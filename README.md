# Analysis of Reptile & Amphibian Observations in Los Angeles County

The purpose of this project is to analyze reptile and amphibian observations that have been collected in Los Angeles County through the iNaturalist1 initiative.  iNaturalist is a social networking service that brings citizen scientists, naturalists, and academics together to crowdsource the observation and identification of living organisms across the globe.  As of the end of October 2020, over 60 million observations have been collected worldwide through this initiative.  Specifically, in this analysis, we will look at the research grade observations that have been collected for the classes Reptilia and Amphibia in Los Angeles County from Nov-2015 through Oct-2020.  Various machine learning algorithms will be utilized in an effort to predict common name groupings of organisms based upon seasonal, geographic, and weather features.
