# Analysis of Reptile & Amphibian Observations in Los Angeles County

The purpose of this project is to analyze reptile and amphibian observations that have been collected in Los Angeles County through the iNaturalist initiative.  iNaturalist is a social networking service that brings citizen scientists, naturalists, and academics together to crowdsource the observation and identification of living organisms across the globe.  In this analysis, we will look at the research grade observations that have been collected for the classes Reptilia and Amphibia in Los Angeles County from Oct-2015 through Sep-2020.  The Random Forest classification algorithm will be utilized in an effort to predict common name groupings of organisms based upon seasonal, geographic, and weather features.
